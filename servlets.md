# Servlets
Servlets are basically individual components of a server that are capable of handling a subset of the request types that would be made to that server. When all the servlets are running together (usually in a servlet container), the host they're running on can then handle any valid request that would be made to that server.

The Jakarta EE servlet specification is linked [here](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet).

A PDF of the specification is also available [here](jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.pdf).

The Java code interface for servlets is described with Jakarta EE's `javax.servlet.Servlet` interface.
