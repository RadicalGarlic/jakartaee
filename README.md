# Servlets
Personal notes on servlets.

Loosely based on scraps of information all over. It's surprisingly difficult to find information on this that isn't a 3000 page implmenter's specification or a 3 sentence blurb on some random blog.

## [Introduction](introduction.md)

## The Servlet Specification
The Jakarta EE servlet specification is linked here: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/

A PDF of the specification is also [included here](jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.pdf).
