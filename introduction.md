# Introduction
Jakarta EE is a collection of specifications that together describe a platform for building enterprise applications.

The specifications describe servlets, JSPs (Jakarta Server Pages), and more.

## History
Jakarta EE is based off of Java EE, which was included in the original release of Java. Like Jakarta EE, Java EE was intended for building enterprise applications.

In the second release of Java, Java EE was separated from the standard Java release into something called "J2EE".

Eventually, J2EE was given over to the Eclipse foundation and was renamed to Jakarta EE for legal reasons. Thus, Jakarta EE is the open source continuation of Java EE.
