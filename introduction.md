# Introduction
Servlets are basically independent components of a server that are capable of handling some of the requests that would be made to a server. When all the servlets are running together (usually in a servlet container), the host they're running on can then handle any valid request that would be made to the server, provided there's a servlet that can handle it.

## History
Servlets were originally defined and specified as a part of Java EE (enterprise edition), which as included as a part of the original Java release.

The second release of Java (Java 2) split off the Java EE components into a separate bundle called J2EE.

Eventually, J2EE was given over to the Eclipse foundation and was renamed to [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/) for legal reasons. Thus, Jakarta EE is the open source continuation of the servlet specification.
